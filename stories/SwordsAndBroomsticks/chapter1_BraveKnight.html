    <h2 class="center">Chapter 1 - A Brave Knight</h2>
    <br>
    <p>There is nothing so wonderful, so magical, so imaginative, then the mind of a six-year-old boy. Every adventure can be lived and fulfilled in a day, each more brilliant than the last. His world is painted in colours of his imagination. He can always escape into it with as much ease as one might walk through a doorway. He can carry it with him wherever he goes, repainting the day with magic as easily as and honestly as one might paint by numbers.  Neville was no exception. He was just such a boy, not so many years ago, of just such an age. He lived in the Land of Eng and played in the United Kingdoms of South Downs. Why they should call it the South Downs had always perplexed him. While it was true, that the United Kingdoms of South Downs was made up of many Kingdoms, the idea of South Downs perplexed him. Neville was full of thoughts. He was so full of thoughts that often they got in the way. Most often they got in the way during school, which was most annoying. They never seemed to bother him during maths or grammar. That was a different kind of wandering. Sleep tended to well up in him during those times. No, his mind filled with wandering thoughts at the adventures of history and science. The worm, one of the creatures that rots the brain, almost never went into more details about exactly why the battle of 1066 didn\’t have knights or why the monks shaved a circle on their heads, so his mind began to fill with possibilities. Before he knew it, he was on the battlefield searching for answers, that is, until the worm snapped her stick upon his desk. The worm was always pacing back and forth near his desk, peering down at him as if he were a tasty morsal ready to be devoured for her next meal. The snapping of her large stick upon his desk often caused him to forget what he questioned in the first place. It made it very difficult to concentrate and find the answer. So it was with the Kingdoms of the South Downs. Why South? From his house, the Kingdoms of the South Downs was West!  And why Downs? Were there more than one, if so, where were the others? And why Down? Why not South Up or North Up or North Down or West Up? It was very perplexing. Whatever the case, Neville only concerned himself with his own kingdom. Being six he had plenty of time to explore the other Kingdoms and other Downs. The Kingdoms of the South Downs was a wonderful place with adventures to fill a lifetime, and at six one truly does have time to live.</p>
    <p class="center">#</p>
    <p>Here is Neville now, skipping along the white chalk pathway upon the cliffside in a rough-cut tabard he made from a white pillowcase and red paint. He brandishes a very large sword, fashioned from the steel of St. George\’s dragon\’s den. It was a mighty day, that day, I can tell you. The fierce dragon laid waste to both land and souls. Flames were everywhere. Brave knights, battling the blaze, ran in and out all day. In the end, the dragon must have been slain, for he was never seen again, and the weary knights left but a smouldering pile of debris. A sword lay there, discarded and broken, beneath the rubble waiting for an owner. It waited for a brave knight, not unlike Arthur, the boy king of long ago. There is nothing left now but ruin and the sword that came out from its battle. But that is another story.</p>
    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Today happened to be a warm day, not unlike that of that great dragon battle. It was often so during the summer months. It was a good time for walking along the cliff-path, where one can see out over the water. Somehow it always made the day seem cooler. On especially hot days it was nice to head down the path to the Grey Lands. The Grey Lands lead to the Snow Lands, where the rocks are pure white. The Snow lands lead to the Kingdom of the Falling Sands, where the fairies lived. He had always wanted to go there, but it was not easy to get to. The fairies guarded it closely and only opened the path once a day. They opened it by pushing back the sea. Then, and only then, could one pass through to the Kingdom and see incredible wonders. </p>
    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp The Falling Sands Kingdom, it was rumoured, were where the fairies dust turned to sand in the twilight, and it fell upon the beach as warm soft sand. Neville was sure it was truly enchanted, for no other beach he had ever seen had sand. One could only get there if one was pure of heart and very brave, for to get there you traverse many dangers. You had to walk up the mountain and through the valley of the Dragon Forest just to get to the Grey Lands. If you followed the path through the forest you came to the Grey Lands, where the rocks have ears and the walls have doorways. It is as far as Neville had ever been. That, however, is another story still. </p>
    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Most of the time the portal is closed with water, making it impassable. The Kingdom disappears altogether, leaving no trace.  Only the fairies can open the portal. But to catch a fairy was no easy task. Neville had tried many times but had never come even close to seeing a fairy up-close, let alone catch one. It was much easier to see that they have opened the gateway and follow after. It stays open for hours and if you are quick enough you can enter and leave without being trapped. But never, never, never stay too long. Without a fairy the water begins to retake the kingdom when the portal closes. If you wait too long there is no way back and you are lost and trapped in the kingdom forever, never to return. It was a wonderful place; but not for today. Today was for conquering enemies and braving fierce beasts and, perhaps, for eating sandwiches. </p>
    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp It had to be getting on towards lunch. He knew so because he found his stomach grumbling and rumbling. He tried to ignore it for as long as he could, but by the time he got to the hedge wall, in the Kingdom of Hare, he had to stop, just for a bite or two, just to stop the grumbling and rumbling, which had become quite annoying. It was so annoying that he found himself reaching into his satchel for something quick and easy to gnaw on, but he knew that would not be proper. Tea, no matter where you were, required manners. One could not just plop down and have at it. One needed to set a place and to pour out properly, even for a sliced cucumber sandwich and thermos of tea. So there, right below the underbrush, Neville took the napkin from around his sandwich and laid it upon the ground. He then neatly placed his sandwich and tea gently upon it as if it were a fine table. There were problems, of course, with carrying ones’ lunch in a napkin tied to ones’ belt. Somehow the bread always got squished and the cucumbers always got warm. Still, it was a welcome meal for a hot day. So, before he feasted upon his repast, Neville put on his knight\’s helmet, knelt down with sword in hand and gave thanks, which was right and proper for a knight to do. When he was finished, he removed his helmet and sat on it, for bucket helmets made wonderful seats.</p>
    <p class="center">#</p>
    <p>He had not been more than a bite in when he heard someone, or some thing, coming towards him, whistling. As the sound grew closer, he noticed it was a familiar tune. It was that of the Colonel Bogey march. Neville got up on his knees and looked around very carefully, for he knew that tune belonged to his old friend Colonel Hillhare. It was the colonel\’s favourite tune. Sure enough, off in the distance, coming towards him the tall grass parted. It swayed back and forth opening and closing around the figure as he moved, his long furry ears peering out over the tall grass like a periscope, until the colonel himself appeared out of the feathered tips of the long grass. </p>
    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp The old colonel had nearly walked past him as if he hadn\’t seen him. He had walked along, resettling his wire-rimmed glasses upon his face, and twirling his long white whiskers almost in a world of his own.</p>
    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp “Hello Colonel”, Neville greeted warmly.</p>
    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp “Neville, my boy! Where did you come from?”</p>
    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp “Edensor\’s Road”, Neville replied earnestly. “I live there.”</p>
    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp The old colonel stroked his white beard at his absentmindedness, then brushed off his fine uniform adorned with elegant trim and shiny brass buttons. Finally, he gave a huff as not to admit he hadn\’t seen the boy.</p>
    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp “Yes, well,” he paused, “quite.”</p>
    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp “Are you hungry?” Neville asked, holding out a bit of cucumber sandwich, which he had broken off for his friend.</p>
    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp “Good heavens, what is this stuff?” The old hare questioned at the thick oily sludge now running down his hand.</p>
    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp  “Cucumber sandwich.”</p>
    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp “What is this…goo?” The old colonel asked before pulling out a handkerchief from his pocket to wipe off his hands.</p>
    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp “I should think,” Neville replied, “it is the mayonnaise.”</p>
    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp “Mayo---what? Don\’t you have any real food?”</p>
    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp “Real food?”</p>
    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp  “Roughage, my boy, roughage. A good soldier should always have some roughage in his diet.”</p>
    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp “I have some lettuce”, Neville replied as he pulled off the leaf of lettuce from his sandwich, carefully wiping off the mayo and handed it to the colonel.</p>
    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp With a good sniff and a smile, the old colonel took the offering and scarfed down the somewhat limp leaf.</p>
    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp “I say! You really are hungry, aren\’t you?” Neville asked.</p>
    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp “Hungry? We’re always hungry. Always looking for food. Hard to feed an army, you know. So many to provide for.”</p>
    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp  “An army? I don\’t see an army”, Neville replied as he looked all around him.</p>
    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp  “Of course you don\’t. Wouldn\’t do to have them out in the open”, the colonel huffed. “Tons of danger you know. Yes, lots of it around here. Worst is the Battling Beetle Brigade. Nasty buggers, the lot of them.”</p>
    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp   “Battling Beetle Brigade?”</p>
    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp  The old colonel pointed to a very large scar as he explained. “Minotaur\’s - Stags; swarms of them. Always looking for a fight. Then there are the dragons. I suspect you’ve had a run-in with them before by the look of that sword of yours.”</p>
    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp  “Oh yes!” Neville replied. “Not today of course. It seems rather quiet. Haven\’t seen a dragon at all.”</p>
    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp  “They’re there. Air strikes, day and night of late. You can hear them coming, even before you can see them. The bombs have…”</p>
    <p>Just then, as if on cue, Captain Whitetail appeared from the brush in a panic.</p>
                     “Sir! Eastern scouts report dragons on the upper ridge headed this way. Looks like a blue squadron.”
                “Blue Dragons”, the old colonel echoed as he picked up the bit of crust and handed it to the young captain before turning his eyes toward the horizon.
                The lanky captain of the guard looked down at the bit of bread, the mayonnaise oozing from the bottom like a sick, leaky gauze. Pulling out a handkerchief from his pocket, he too gently placed the bit of bread on the ground and wiped his hands, waiting for orders.
                “How many?” Asked the colonel.
                “Initial reports indicate a dozen or more.”
                The old colonel stepped close to Neville and gave him a keen eye and a grin. “So, master Neville, are you up for a fight? It won\’t be easy. Best we can hope for is to die driving them off; posthumous medal, women weeping and all that.  Are you game?” he asked, stepping up on Neville\’s lap and looking him straight in the eye. “I’ll take that as a yes.”
                #
                There were several kinds of dragons indigenous to the Kingdoms of the South Downs. There were Red Dragons; very small, very fast, single or double-winged, and their breath was like fire. You wouldn\’t want to get stung by one of these. Red dragons were traditionally known for protecting treasure. There were Grey Dragons. These creatures had beautiful silver double wings with dewdrop diamonds that sparkled in the sun. They had the power to appear and disappear at will, making them extremely difficult to fight. They could float, rather than hover, so they were rather quiet in their approach. They were typically not deadly, but nearly impossible to engage. Then there were the Blue Dragons. They were single-winged larger dragons that bite. They were actually rather beautiful, with their pretty blue bodies with black rings. It was unclear if they possessed any magical powers, but they never gave up the fight. They were the worst. It was rumoured that it was a Blue Dragon that the knights battled on High Street that terrible day, but no bodies were ever found. There were also Yellow Dragons. They too had black rings, making them look like a cross between a dragon and a bumblebee. They had single wings and had the ability to mesmerize their enemy. Then there were Green Dragons; small, double-winged and always in groups. They were extremely rare creatures in the Kingdoms of South Downs. There had not been a reported sighting in over a hundred years. Some say there were mythical creatures from the land of Ire, which is said to be entirely green, even the people. Green Dragons were traditionally passive creatures, more interested in protecting the forest and small creatures than fighting, but some say they can be bribed to fight, and they fight to the death.
                There was only one reason Neville could think of for the Blue Dragon Squadron to swarm the hedge line and that reason was blueberries. There was only one reason for the dragons to want blueberries and that is to make blue sapphires.  It is a well-known fact that when Blue Dragons eat blueberries and then lay an egg, it hatches into a blue crystal.  Red Dragons eat strawberries and hatch rubies. Grey Dragons eat rock and hatch moonstones. Green Dragons hatch emeralds, Yellow Dragons hatch yellow sapphires, and rare Purple Dragons hatch amethyst.
                Today\’s battle, however, was not about riches, rubies, or revenge. Today was about survival and the protection of family and friends. Wars are often fought, but none so honourable than to protect ones’ family and food supply. The inhabitants of the Village of Hares were Neville\’s friends. The Kingdom of Hare spanned from the start of the footpath, past the Thicket Forest, and past Hare\’s Head. His friends lived in the hedge-line just past Thicket Forest, where Neville made his fort. The hares were typically a friendly lot and hated violence. They were mostly farmers. For years they were attacked for their blueberries, for theirs were the biggest and plumpest blueberries in the Kingdoms of the Souths Downs. But the hares were largely unprotected. All they could do was run. Then, one day, a brave young hare picked up a sword and stood his ground. He saved dozens of blueberries that day. The next time the dragons attacked, a dozen more hare stood up with him. The time after that, a hundred stood up with him. That brave young hare was Colonel James Royal Hillhare. 
                Neville met the old colonel one day on that very same battlefield. Neville was fighting a dragon; a nasty Yellow Dragon, and I am sorry to say, not very well. Yellow dragons look fierce. Their bodies are fat and their tails have large spikes on the tip. They make a loud shrill sound as well. Neville didn\’t know at the time, but most of the flash and fury was to ward off. Yellow Dragons don\’t attack unless they are threatened or protecting something. If he had stood still the dragon may have passed him by without notice. Such was not the case. But suddenly, and without warning, the dragon pulled off. Someone else had drawn its fire. It was the colonel. He had come without asking and without desire of riches or glory. He had come simply to help. While there were many battles, ones fought for family and fought with friends were the ones that mattered most. Today, however, the battle would not be like those that came before. Today was not just one or two dragons, it was a squadron of dragons. It was war!
                Captain Whitetail blew his trumpet and a hundred soldiers emerged from the hedge. They lined up row by row in neat lines ready to fight. The old colonel drew his sword and held it high in the air, holding back his troops until just the right moment. Neville felt his heart pound in his chest. He drew his sword and held it fast with both hands. The air was still and quiet; so still that not even the grass moved. Were they coming? Had their information been wrong? Neville looked at the old colonel who was staring intently at the skyline with his nose twitching wildly.
                #
                There was a soft noise in the distance, like a hum that grew louder as each second ticked by. The hum soon turned into a roar, a roar of flapping wings against a thousand scales. The dragons were coming…and something else; a sound Neville was not familiar with. The sound was like a rumbling buzzing noise against armour. Then…
                “Beetles!!!” Captain Whitetail shouted out the warning.
                The Fighting Hares drew their swords and began to roar loudly as they beat upon their shields, preparing for a difficult fight. Neville had never fought the Battling Beetle Brigade before, but by the looks of the old colonel\’s scar, they were terrifying beasts. Now was not the time to be afraid, however. Now was a time for protecting women and children, for protecting the food stores, the homes, and their shops. Now was a time to be brave as only a knight can be brave.
                From out of the sun they came, whizzing and whirling. The dragons came first, their blue scales shimmering in the sun. They made directly for the hedge-line, for the blueberries. Then, just as they came into full view they broke off into groups, attacking from every side. Neville swung his great sword, but they were too fast, too smart, too many of them. They drew the Fighting Hares further and further away from the hedge. And just as it looked as if the Fighting Hares had pushed them back, the Battling Beetle Brigade swarmed in, heading directly for Hare\’s Head.
                “Neville!” The colonel shouted. “Protect the hedge! Whatever happens, don\’t let them get to the food stores!”
                Neville looked up toward the hedges. Women and children were scrambling to their homes and safe places underground. The blueberry patch was entirely unprotected. It was up to him and him alone to protect the village. With his great sword, Neville took careful aim against the dragons as he made his way up the hillside. He downed dragon after dragon, suffering the burning sting of their bites. His sword marred with dragon\’s blood and singed from dragon\’s breath, Neville pushed his way to the top. It was there he came face to face with the Beetle Brigade. 
                They were a fearsome lot, heavily laden with thick dark leather armour. They had a double set of wings, the inner thin and flexible, the outer a hard, leathery protection yet freely moving. Even their eyes were protected by armoured goggles. They had large, jagged claws, like a saw, that crushed through bone and metal. They seemed impenetrable. Neville looked frantically for any weakness, trying not to let his fear get the better of him. Then he saw it. The Beetle Brigade heavily armed their front, but the rear was less protected. He would have to somehow come up behind them and he had to do it quickly. They were almost at Hare\’s Head. He had to get there, and fast, or all would be lost.  Setting his helmet firmly, if a bit wobbly for the fit, he thrust his sword fiercely as he climbed the hill.
                Halfway up the hedge-line, with the blueberry patch in sight, Neville felt sure they had won the day. He was almost there; just a few yards more. It was then he saw the truth of it. The Beetle Brigade was already there, tearing at the food stores. His presence detected, a swarm came at him, the likes of which he had never seen. There had to be a dozen or more. All was lost.
                Neville readied his great sword and prepared to fight to the death. He no longer thought of himself or his own safety. This was war and it meant the difference of his friends making it through the winter or not. He had to succeed. Charging directly for the Beetle Brigade, Neville burst through their tough armour with sheer force, driving them off one by one as he made his way to the heart of the stores and the heart of the battle. 
                    Inch by inch, beetle by beetle, Neville fought his way through the thick brush until he came to the top. It was there, just as he thought he had won, that he saw the truth of it. A large Blue Dragon awaited him. It stared him down. Each knew the other would not yield. Just then the dragon rushed towards him, knocking him for six, head over heals over the blueberry store and down the slope.
                It was a blueberry mess for the village. Blueberries flew everywhere. They landed everywhere as the Battling Beetle Brigade cut and slashed at the berries and bushes. It\’s an odd wonderful thing about hares. They have such a warm positive attitude toward everything. They can turn the worst of days into the best of days.  As the blueberries flung to the four corners of the village, the villagers came out of hiding and began collecting them. It became a day of harvest unlike any other. There would be blueberry pies and blueberry cakes. There would be blueberry salads and blueberry plates. Blueberries with strawberries and blueberries with dates. They would feast for a week in honour of their hero. But where was their hero? The colonel had returned, but Neville was not where he had left him.
                “Colonel,” the captain of the guard called in almost a whisper, motioning for him to come.
                The colonel straightened his uniform, settled his hat and prepared for the worst. Many of the villagers followed to see what had become of their friend. At the edge of the brush lay the small knight\’s helmet, abandoned by its owner. Further down lay his half-eaten cucumber sandwich, peaking out of its cloth napkin. Then, there in the sunlight, the old colonel saw his friend, a little worse for the are.
