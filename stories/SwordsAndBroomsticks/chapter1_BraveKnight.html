    <br>
    <p>There is nothing so wonderful, so magical, so imaginative, then the mind of a six-year-old boy. Every adventure can be lived and fulfilled in a day, each more brilliant than the last. His world is painted in colours of his imagination. He can always escape into it with as much ease as one might walk through a doorway. He can carry it with him wherever he goes, repainting the day with magic as easily as and honestly as one might paint by numbers.  Neville was no exception. He was just such a boy, not so many years ago, of just such an age. He lived in the Land of Eng and played in the United Kingdoms of South Downs. Why they should call it the South Downs had always perplexed him. While it was true, that the United Kingdoms of South Downs was made up of many Kingdoms, the idea of South Downs perplexed him. Neville was full of thoughts. He was so full of thoughts that often they got in the way. Most often they got in the way during school, which was most annoying. They never seemed to bother him during maths or grammar. That was a different kind of wandering. Sleep tended to well up in him during those times. No, his mind filled with wandering thoughts at the adventures of history and science. The worm, one of the creatures that rots the brain, almost never went into more details about exactly why the battle of 1066 didn't have knights or why the monks shaved a circle on their heads, so his mind began to fill with possibilities. Before he knew it, he was on the battlefield searching for answers, that is, until the worm snapped her stick upon his desk. The worm was always pacing back and forth near his desk, peering down at him as if he were a tasty morsal ready to be devoured for her next meal. The snapping of her large stick upon his desk often caused him to forget what he questioned in the first place. It made it very difficult to concentrate and find the answer. So it was with the Kingdoms of the South Downs. Why South? From his house, the Kingdoms of the South Downs was West!  And why Downs? Were there more than one, if so, where were the others? And why Down? Why not South Up or North Up or North Down or West Up? It was very perplexing. Whatever the case, Neville only concerned himself with his own kingdom. Being six he had plenty of time to explore the other Kingdoms and other Downs. The Kingdoms of the South Downs was a wonderful place with adventures to fill a lifetime, and at six one truly does have time to live.</p>
    <h6 class="center">#</h6>
    <p>Here is Neville now, skipping along the white chalk pathway upon the cliffside in a rough-cut tabard he made from a white pillowcase and red paint. He brandishes a very large sword, fashioned from the steel of St. George's dragon's den. It was a mighty day, that day, I can tell you. The fierce dragon laid waste to both land and souls. Flames were everywhere. Brave knights, battling the blaze, ran in and out all day. In the end, the dragon must have been slain, for he was never seen again, and the weary knights left but a smouldering pile of debris. A sword lay there, discarded and broken, beneath the rubble waiting for an owner. It waited for a brave knight, not unlike Arthur, the boy king of long ago. There is nothing left now but ruin and the sword that came out from its battle. But that is another story.</p>
    <p>Today happened to be a warm day, not unlike that of that great dragon battle. It was often so during the summer months. It was a good time for walking along the cliff-path, where one can see out over the water. Somehow it always made the day seem cooler. On especially hot days it was nice to head down the path to the Grey Lands. The Grey Lands lead to the Snow Lands, where the rocks are pure white. The Snow lands lead to the Kingdom of the Falling Sands, where the fairies lived. He had always wanted to go there, but it was not easy to get to. The fairies guarded it closely and only opened the path once a day. They opened it by pushing back the sea. Then, and only then, could one pass through to the Kingdom and see incredible wonders. </p>
    <p>The Falling Sands Kingdom, it was rumoured, were where the fairies dust turned to sand in the twilight, and it fell upon the beach as warm soft sand. Neville was sure it was truly enchanted, for no other beach he had ever seen had sand. One could only get there if one was pure of heart and very brave, for to get there you traverse many dangers. You had to walk up the mountain and through the valley of the Dragon Forest just to get to the Grey Lands. If you followed the path through the forest you came to the Grey Lands, where the rocks have ears and the walls have doorways. It is as far as Neville had ever been. That, however, is another story still. </p>
    <p>Most of the time the portal is closed with water, making it impassable. The Kingdom disappears altogether, leaving no trace.  Only the fairies can open the portal. But to catch a fairy was no easy task. Neville had tried many times but had never come even close to seeing a fairy up-close, let alone catch one. It was much easier to see that they have opened the gateway and follow after. It stays open for hours and if you are quick enough you can enter and leave without being trapped. But never, never, never stay too long. Without a fairy the water begins to retake the kingdom when the portal closes. If you wait too long there is no way back and you are lost and trapped in the kingdom forever, never to return. It was a wonderful place; but not for today. Today was for conquering enemies and braving fierce beasts and, perhaps, for eating sandwiches. </p>
    <p>It had to be getting on towards lunch. He knew so because he found his stomach grumbling and rumbling. He tried to ignore it for as long as he could, but by the time he got to the hedge wall, in the Kingdom of Hare, he had to stop, just for a bite or two, just to stop the grumbling and rumbling, which had become quite annoying. It was so annoying that he found himself reaching into his satchel for something quick and easy to gnaw on, but he knew that would not be proper. Tea, no matter where you were, required manners. One could not just plop down and have at it. One needed to set a place and to pour out properly, even for a sliced cucumber sandwich and thermos of tea. So there, right below the underbrush, Neville took the napkin from around his sandwich and laid it upon the ground. He then neatly placed his sandwich and tea gently upon it as if it were a fine table. There were problems, of course, with carrying ones’ lunch in a napkin tied to ones’ belt. Somehow the bread always got squished and the cucumbers always got warm. Still, it was a welcome meal for a hot day. So, before he feasted upon his repast, Neville put on his knight's helmet, knelt down with sword in hand and gave thanks, which was right and proper for a knight to do. When he was finished, he removed his helmet and sat on it, for bucket helmets made wonderful seats.</p>
    <p class="center">#</p>
    <p>He had not been more than a bite in when he heard someone, or some thing, coming towards him, whistling. As the sound grew closer, he noticed it was a familiar tune. It was that of the Colonel Bogey march. Neville got up on his knees and looked around very carefully, for he knew that tune belonged to his old friend Colonel Hillhare. It was the colonel's favourite tune. Sure enough, off in the distance, coming towards him the tall grass parted. It swayed back and forth opening and closing around the figure as he moved, his long furry ears peering out over the tall grass like a periscope, until the colonel himself appeared out of the feathered tips of the long grass. </p>
    <p>The old colonel had nearly walked past him as if he hadn't seen him. He had walked along, resettling his wire-rimmed glasses upon his face, and twirling his long white whiskers almost in a world of his own.</p>
    <p class="indented">“Hello Colonel”, Neville greeted warmly.</p>
    <p class="indented">“Neville, my boy! Where did you come from?”</p>
    <p class="indented">“Edensor's Road”, Neville replied earnestly. “I live there.”</p>
    <p class="indented">Colonel Whitehare stroked his white beard at his absentmindedness, then brushed off his fine uniform adorned with elegant trim and shiny brass buttons. Finally, he gave a huff as not to admit he hadn't seen the boy.</p>
    <p class="indented">“Yes, well,” he paused, “quite.”</p>
    <p class="indented"a>“Are you hungry?” Neville asked, holding out a bit of cucumber sandwich, which he had broken off for his friend.</p>
    <p class="indented">“Good heavens, what is this stuff?” The old hare questioned at the thick oily sludge now running down his hand.</p>
    <p class="indented">“Cucumber sandwich.”</p>
    <p class="indented">“What is this…goo?” The old colonel asked before pulling out a handkerchief from his pocket to wipe off his hands.</p>
    <p class="indented">“I should think,” Neville replied, “it is the mayonnaise.”</p>
    <p class="indented">“Mayo---what? Don't you have any real food?”</p>
    <p class="indented">“Real food?”</p>
    <p class="indented">“Roughage, my boy, roughage. A good soldier should always have some roughage in his diet.”</p>
    <p class="indented">“I have some lettuce”, Neville replied as he pulled off the leaf of lettuce from his sandwich, carefully wiping off the mayo and handed it to the colonel.</p>
    <p>With a good sniff and a smile, the colonel took the offering and scarfed down the somewhat limp leaf.</p>
    <p class="indented">“I say! You really are hungry, aren't you?” Neville asked.</p>
    <p class="indented">“Hungry? We’re always hungry. Always looking for food. Hard to feed an army, you know. So many to provide for.”</p>
    <p class="indented">“An army? I don't see an army”, Neville replied as he looked all around him.</p>
    <p class="indented">“Of course you don't. Wouldn't do to have them out in the open”, the colonel huffed. “Tons of danger you know. Yes, lots of it around here. Worst is the Battling Beetle Brigade. Nasty buggers, the lot of them.”</p>
    <p class="indented">“Battling Beetle Brigade?”</p>
    <p>Colonel Whitehare pointed to a very large scar as he explained. “Minotaur's - Stags; swarms of them. Always looking for a fight. Then there are the dragons. I suspect you’ve had a run-in with them before by the look of that sword of yours.”</p>
    <p class="indented">“Oh yes!” Neville replied. “Not today of course. It seems rather quiet. Haven't seen a dragon at all.”</p>
    <p class="indented">“They’re there. Air strikes, day and night of late. You can hear them coming, even before you can see them. The bombs have…”</p>
    <p>Just then, as if on cue, Captain Whitetail appeared from the brush in a panic.</p>
    <p class="indented">“Sir! Eastern scouts report dragons on the upper ridge headed this way. Looks like a blue squadron.”</p>
    <p class="indented">“Blue Dragons”, the old colonel echoed as he picked up the bit of crust and handed it to the young captain before turning his eyes toward the horizon.</p>
    <p> The lanky captain of the guard looked down at the bit of bread, the mayonnaise oozing from the bottom like a sick, leaky gauze. Pulling out a handkerchief from his pocket, he too gently placed the bit of bread on the ground and wiped his hands, waiting for orders.</p>
    <p class="indented">“How many?” Asked the colonel.</p>
    <p class="indented">“Initial reports indicate a dozen or more.”</p>
    <p class="indented">Colonel Whitehare stepped close to Neville and gave him a keen eye and a grin. “So, master Neville, are you up for a fight? It won't be easy. Best we can hope for is to die driving them off; posthumous medal, women weeping and all that.  Are you game?” he asked, stepping up on Neville's lap and looking him straight in the eye. “I’ll take that as a yes.”</p>
    <p class="center">#</p>
    <p>There were several kinds of dragons indigenous to the Kingdoms of the South Downs. There were Red Dragons; very small, very fast, single or double-winged, and their breath was like fire. You wouldn't want to get stung by one of these. Red dragons were traditionally known for protecting treasure. There were Grey Dragons. These creatures had beautiful silver double wings with dewdrop diamonds that sparkled in the sun. They had the power to appear and disappear at will, making them extremely difficult to fight. They could float, rather than hover, so they were rather quiet in their approach. They were typically not deadly, but nearly impossible to engage. Then there were the Blue Dragons. They were single-winged larger dragons that bite. They were actually rather beautiful, with their pretty blue bodies with black rings. It was unclear if they possessed any magical powers, but they never gave up the fight. They were the worst. It was rumoured that it was a Blue Dragon that the knights battled on High Street that terrible day, but no bodies were ever found. There were also Yellow Dragons. They too had black rings, making them look like a cross between a dragon and a bumblebee. They had single wings and had the ability to mesmerize their enemy. Then there were Green Dragons; small, double-winged and always in groups. They were extremely rare creatures in the Kingdoms of South Downs. There had not been a reported sighting in over a hundred years. Some say there were mythical creatures from the land of Ire, which is said to be entirely green, even the people. Green Dragons were traditionally passive creatures, more interested in protecting the forest and small creatures than fighting, but some say they can be bribed to fight, and they fight to the death.</p>
    <p>There was only one reason Neville could think of for the Blue Dragon Squadron to swarm the hedge line and that reason was blueberries. There was only one reason for the dragons to want blueberries and that is to make blue sapphires.  It is a well-known fact that when Blue Dragons eat blueberries and then lay an egg, it hatches into a blue crystal.  Red Dragons eat strawberries and hatch rubies. Grey Dragons eat rock and hatch moonstones. Green Dragons hatch emeralds, Yellow Dragons hatch yellow sapphires, and rare Purple Dragons hatch amethyst.</p>
    <p>Today's battle, however, was not about riches, rubies, or revenge. Today was about survival and the protection of family and friends. Wars are often fought, but none so honourable than to protect ones’ family and food supply. The inhabitants of the Village of Hares were Neville's friends. The Kingdom of Hare spanned from the start of the footpath, past the Thicket Forest, and past Hare's Head. His friends lived in the hedge-line just past Thicket Forest, where Neville made his fort. The hares were typically a friendly lot and hated violence. They were mostly farmers. For years they were attacked for their blueberries, for theirs were the biggest and plumpest blueberries in the Kingdoms of the Souths Downs. But the hares were largely unprotected. All they could do was run. Then, one day, a brave young hare picked up a sword and stood his ground. He saved dozens of blueberries that day. The next time the dragons attacked, a dozen more hare stood up with him. The time after that, a hundred stood up with him. That brave young hare was Colonel James Royal Hillhare. </p>
    <p>Neville met the old colonel one day on that very same battlefield. Neville was fighting a dragon; a nasty Yellow Dragon, and I am sorry to say, not very well. Yellow dragons look fierce. Their bodies are fat and their tails have large spikes on the tip. They make a loud shrill sound as well. Neville didn't know at the time, but most of the flash and fury was to ward off. Yellow Dragons don't attack unless they are threatened or protecting something. If he had stood still the dragon may have passed him by without notice. Such was not the case. But suddenly, and without warning, the dragon pulled off. Someone else had drawn its fire. It was the colonel. He had come without asking and without desire of riches or glory. He had come simply to help. While there were many battles, ones fought for family and fought with friends were the ones that mattered most. Today, however, the battle would not be like those that came before. Today was not just one or two dragons, it was a squadron of dragons. It was war!</p>
    <p>Captain Whitetail blew his trumpet and a hundred soldiers emerged from the hedge. They lined up row by row in neat lines ready to fight. Colonel Whitehare drew his sword and held it high in the air, holding back his troops until just the right moment. Neville felt his heart pound in his chest. He drew his sword and held it fast with both hands. The air was still and quiet; so still that not even the grass moved. Were they coming? Had their information been wrong? Neville looked at the old colonel who was staring intently at the skyline with his nose twitching wildly.</p>
    <p class="center">#</p>
    <p>There was a soft noise in the distance, like a hum that grew louder as each second ticked by. The hum soon turned into a roar, a roar of flapping wings against a thousand scales. The dragons were coming…and something else; a sound Neville was not familiar with. The sound was like a rumbling buzzing noise against armour. Then…</p>
    <p class="indented">“Beetles!!!” Captain Whitetail shouted out the warning.</p>
    <p>The Fighting Hares drew their swords and began to roar loudly as they beat upon their shields, preparing for a difficult fight. Neville had never fought the Battling Beetle Brigade before, but by the looks of the old colonel's scar, they were terrifying beasts. Now was not the time to be afraid, however. Now was a time for protecting women and children, for protecting the food stores, the homes, and their shops. Now was a time to be brave as only a knight can be brave.</p>
    <p>From out of the sun they came, whizzing and whirling. The dragons came first, their blue scales shimmering in the sun. They made directly for the hedge-line, for the blueberries. Then, just as they came into full view they broke off into groups, attacking from every side. Neville swung his great sword, but they were too fast, too smart, too many of them. They drew the Fighting Hares further and further away from the hedge. And just as it looked as if the Fighting Hares had pushed them back, the Battling Beetle Brigade swarmed in, heading directly for Hare's Head.</p>
    <p>“Neville!” The colonel shouted. “Protect the hedge! Whatever happens, don't let them get to the food stores!”</p>
    <p>Neville looked up toward the hedges. Women and children were scrambling to their homes and safe places underground. The blueberry patch was entirely unprotected. It was up to him and him alone to protect the village. With his great sword, Neville took careful aim against the dragons as he made his way up the hillside. He downed dragon after dragon, suffering the burning sting of their bites. His sword marred with dragon's blood and singed from dragon's breath, Neville pushed his way to the top. It was there he came face to face with the Beetle Brigade. </p>
    <p>They were a fearsome lot, heavily laden with thick dark leather armour. They had a double set of wings, the inner thin and flexible, the outer a hard, leathery protection yet freely moving. Even their eyes were protected by armoured goggles. They had large, jagged claws, like a saw, that crushed through bone and metal. They seemed impenetrable. Neville looked frantically for any weakness, trying not to let his fear get the better of him. Then he saw it. The Beetle Brigade heavily armed their front, but the rear was less protected. He would have to somehow come up behind them and he had to do it quickly. They were almost at Hare's Head. He had to get there, and fast, or all would be lost.  Setting his helmet firmly, if a bit wobbly for the fit, he thrust his sword fiercely as he climbed the hill.</p>
    <p>Halfway up the hedge-line, with the blueberry patch in sight, Neville felt sure they had won the day. He was almost there; just a few yards more. It was then he saw the truth of it. The Beetle Brigade was already there, tearing at the food stores. His presence detected, a swarm came at him, the likes of which he had never seen. There had to be a dozen or more. All was lost.</p>
    <p>Neville readied his great sword and prepared to fight to the death. He no longer thought of himself or his own safety. This was war and it meant the difference of his friends making it through the winter or not. He had to succeed. Charging directly for the Beetle Brigade, Neville burst through their tough armour with sheer force, driving them off one by one as he made his way to the heart of the stores and the heart of the battle. </p>
    <p>Inch by inch, beetle by beetle, Neville fought his way through the thick brush until he came to the top. It was there, just as he thought he had won, that he saw the truth of it. A large Blue Dragon awaited him. It stared him down. Each knew the other would not yield. Just then the dragon rushed towards him, knocking him for six, head over heals over the blueberry store and down the slope.</p>
    <p>It was a blueberry mess for the village. Blueberries flew everywhere. They landed everywhere as the Battling Beetle Brigade cut and slashed at the berries and bushes. It's an odd wonderful thing about hares. They have such a warm positive attitude toward everything. They can turn the worst of days into the best of days.  As the blueberries flung to the four corners of the village, the villagers came out of hiding and began collecting them. It became a day of harvest unlike any other. There would be blueberry pies and blueberry cakes. There would be blueberry salads and blueberry plates. Blueberries with strawberries and blueberries with dates. They would feast for a week in honour of their hero. But where was their hero? The colonel had returned, but Neville was not where he had left him.</p>
    <p class="indented">“Colonel,” the captain of the guard called in almost a whisper, motioning for him to come.</p>
    <p>The colonel straightened his uniform, settled his hat and prepared for the worst. Many of the villagers followed to see what had become of their friend. At the edge of the brush lay the small knight's helmet, abandoned by its owner. Further down lay his half-eaten cucumber sandwich, peaking out of its cloth napkin. Then, there in the sunlight, the old colonel saw his friend, a little worse for the are.</p>              
    <p class="center">#</p>
    <p>The small knight knelt over his sword and wondered to himself how best to right it; for you see, the handle wiggled, and no matter how many times he nailed it in place, the handle would not stop wiggling. It was a very large sword and thus required a very sturdy handle. What he needed was - a rock; for everyone knows that rocks were the best things to put nails in swords, outside of a hammer that is. But if one does not have a hammer one can always count on a rock.</p>
    <p>The colonel put a hand on the small knight’s back and gave it a pat. And with an order he sent his troops out to scour the countryside for just the right rock. It could not be just any rock. It had to be an especially made for putting nails in swords rock. Nail rocks had to be grey for they were the strongest rocks. Today, however, they seemed to be in short supply. They found white rocks. They found speckled rocks. They found red rocks with stripes. And while there were plenty of pretty rocks, everyone knows that pretty rocks were not the best things to use on nails for swords. Sword nails were much too strong. Swords required grey rocks to pound in nails, but all of those rocks were stuck in the ground or way too big. </p>
    <p>Neville tried the white rocks, but they broke. He tried the red rocks, but they bent the nails. He tried the striped rocks and speckled rocks, but they too broke the nails. Now it was truly broken. With no grey rocks to be found and the nails he had, bent and broken, the little knight laid out his sword upon the ground.</p>
    <p class="indented">“It’s no good,” Neville said. “It’s going to need new nails.”</p>
    <p class="indented">“I’m afraid so,” the colonel agreed.</p>
    <p>The colonel could see the worry on Neville’s face. They all could, for new nails meant only one thing. Neville would have to go across the vast wilderness to the next kingdom. Not just any kingdom either. Neville would have to travel to the Kingdom of Grups. Grups were like Neville, only bigger and not so kind. Grups came with guns. Grups came with sprays. Grups came with mowers that cut and blades that chopped. Grups never looked where they were going or who might be in the way. There were worse things too. There were Tweens. They lived in the Kingdom of Grups along with grups and heroes. Tweens were neither grups nor heroes. They were somewhere in-between. They were the worst things ever; worse than dragons, worse than beetles, worse than grups with slashers and sprays. Tweens were loud. Tweens were careless. Tweens liked to maim and kill and torcher things just for fun. They were a horrible species that struck fear in all the kingdoms, even the grups. </p>
    <p>It was the only way to fix his sword, however. It would require a long and perilous journey. He must go past the Kingdom of Grups, past the lighted poles and black sea to get to the dreaded Cave of Dyre.  He had to see the large red bearded troll and buy some new nails. It would take many days and nights to reach him - or at least an hour or two. And even if he should brave the perils of land and beast the old troll may decide to eat him rather than sell him the just right sword nails. But for all the little knight’s concerns, waving his trusty sword to and fro, it would not do. The handle still wiggled. He would just have to go, even if it meant his life.</p>
    <p>Set firm upon his quest, the brave little knight set about the treacherous lands far and wide, ready to battle wild beasts and fiery dragons with his bare hands. He had to; for a sword with a broken hilt is of little use against wild beasts or dragons.</p>
    <p class="indented">“We will take you as far as the borderlands,” Captain Whitetail said.</p>
    <p>And so the little knight picked up his sword, secured his helmet to his belt, and set off with a squadron of Fighting Hares across the vast wilderness to find the dwelling of the troll. </p>
    <p class="center">#</p>
    <p>The red bearded troll, whose name was MR Dyer, owned a cave that was on the main street in the village of Mead. Getting there was only the first challenge. To get to the Cave of Dyre Neville had to break two firm rules his dragon set down for him. One: He was never to cross the black sea, unless it was to go to the Kingdoms of South Downs. Even then he could only go as far as the Kingdom of Hare. The Kingdom of Beaches and the Kingdom of the Fallings Sands were forbidden, as were the kingdoms beyond them.  And Two: He was never to talk to Grups or Tweens he did not know. This presented a problem as the only Grups he knew were Worms. Worms ran the schools. Horrible creatures they were too. Whatever they wrote they erased, so you could never remember what they said. Neville often wondered if they did so because they had no brains of their own, and so forgot what they just said. That would make sense in terms of them erasing everything they wrote. They wouldn’t remember what it meant. They hated everyone one and every thing. They wouldn’t let you outside except for a minute or two, forcing you to sweat and squirm in the heat of their lair. They were always cross and always telling you that your own thoughts were of no use. Therefore, even if he did see a Worm, it would be of little use.</p>
    <p>To reach the troll one had to face three additional perilous dangers to breaking the dragon’s rules. The first was to pass through the magic portal. It was barred by a large wooden door sealed by magic with a large clanging bell to announce the intrusion.  It had once presented a problem, but now that he had attained the ripe old age of six and his muscles firm through training, he was able to manage it with only a little difficulty. The fear, however, was another story. The fear had already started to well up inside of him. They were almost at the borderlands. His friends could not go with him any further. Neville was not the only one to have rules. The old colonel had lived as long as he did by surviving many perils. To pass on the wisdom of his adventures he convinced the Counsel of Hare to draw up rules to abide by to keep the community safe. They may not have had Worms to contend with, but they did know the black sea was dangerous, even more so for hares than heroes.  Their rules about grups and tweens were similar too, for breaking these rules could well mean death. Captain Whitetail knew this all too well. </p>
    <p>Standing at the edge of the borderlands, Captain Whitetail put a comforting hand on Neville’s arm. He watched as the loud beasts moved over the waters of the black sea with disregard. He saw grups and tweens everywhere, and he felt afraid for his friend. It was then he knew what he must do.</p>
    <p class="indented">“I’m coming with you,” the captain announced.</p>
    <p class="indented">“You can’t!” Neville insisted. “You know as well as I do that grups eat hares. I will be fine. I’ve done it before.”</p>
    <p class="indented">Captain Whitetail looked at his friend in amused admiration. “You never cease to amaze me, Neville. I never knew you crossed the black sea.”</p>
    <p class="indented">“Oh yes! I went down to see the knights fight the fire the Blue Dragon set. That’s how I got my sword. I’ve been there several times. There is a machine with bottled soda near the old ruin and I go there whenever I have farthing. Don’t worry. I can make it.”</p>
    <p>With that, Captain Whitetail released his friend into the Kingdom of Grups.</p>
    <p class="center">#</p>
    <p>Neville made his way down the steep slopes of the borderlands and into the Kingdom of Grups. Before he knew it his fears seemed to melt away. Perhaps it is because he had made similar journeys before. Perhaps it was because he no longer had his friends to worry about, or perhaps it was the excitement of venturing to foreign lands. Whatever the reason, his fear temporarily left him and he traversed the perils like a pro. Actually, crossing the black sea wasn’t so bad. The trick was to find the flashing poles and walk between them. That is, after you made sure the loud mechanical beasts actually paid attention to the flashing poles. Sometimes they didn’t. Sometimes the grups didn’t bother to look and they barrelled through without notice. This is why it was so dangerous for the subjects of the Kingdoms of South Downs. They were small and often they could not be seen. Neville was six now. He started to be seen by grups and tweens, though sometimes he wished he could still be invisible.</p>
    <p>Just a hop, skip, and a jump, Neville was down the street and standing before the Cave of Dyre. Getting there was only the first challenge. He had to actually find the troll, whilst not getting eaten by him. The three additional perilous still face him. The first was to pass through the magic portal. So, with a deep breath, the little knight grasped the handle and with a firm grip against the wind and put his shoulder into it and passed through the portal and great door - if only just. There was a clanging noise, as from a bell. That was new. Neville turned around and saw a small black and brass bell attached to the upper portion of the great door. It still jiggled a bit from the motion, though it had stopped its alarm. Had it rousted the giant troll? Neville held his breath and waited perfectly still. It didn’t appear as if the old troll took any notice of it. For the moment, Neville was safe.</p>
    <p>The second trial was “the wall”. If one could get past the portal and through the magic door, one had to face one of four pathways filled floor to ceiling with all manner of things. Some pathways lead only to other pathways. A few, however opened to an island guarded by a huge wall. On the ledge of the eastern wall was a bell and the bell had to be rung to summon the troll. The wall was so high that the little knight could just manage a hand over the edge on tip toes to ring the summoning bell. But ring it he must in order to summon the large red bearded troll. </p>
    <p>The third trial was facing the troll himself, who was surely a magical troll.  He appeared and disappeared almost without a sound into the Troll Cave. This was no easy feat, as he stood over 42 hands high - that is to say, Neville’s hands. The troll’s huge lumbering arms and mighty legs were outdone only by his thick red beard with white streaks, all covering a huge thick neck. The troll lived in a cave and only came out at night; and then only to seal the door and portal. He had to be summoned if you wanted him. Neville had once seen a glimpse of the cave in which the troll parked himself. It was filled, floor to ceiling, with musty old books, a lamp, and a pot always steaming as if ready for a meat pie victim. He had heard rumors of children going in and never coming out.</p>
    <p>It was a scary thought, but he had to press on, for a knight with a broken sword was no knight. Without his sword how could he defend the kingdom, let alone whack bushes? No; he would have to muster all his courage and face the troll. He had been here once before, so choosing a path shouldn’t have presented a problem, yet a problem it was. The path he had taken before was barred by large boulders, stacked one on top of the other. It looked too unsteady to climb. He would just have to choose another path; but which one? </p>
    <p class="center">#</p>
    <p>The little knight clutched his sword and walked slowly past the choices. The middle path seemed the shortest route. He calculated that a sharp turn in the middle would see him directly to the wall. So the middle one it was and his mind determined he set forth slowly, watching carefully for the troll or any other hidden dangers. Today, however, the road seemed clear. There was no one about and he reached the crossroad without incident. If memory served, the crossroads lead three directions. One might think that the middle path lead directly to “the wall”, but he recalled that it did not. Halfway down the path was a large tree. The path narrowed to such a point that not even a young hero could squeeze by without the possibility of being caught on one of the hooks or metal to either side. No; it had to be…the left path, or was it the right. The problem with being six is that knowing your right from your left is so difficult to remember. The path was… “that way”!</p>
    <p>Neville stopped for a moment, for it didn’t seem quite the way he remembered. He felt sure there were rows and rows of paint in buckets. There was a sign above that was bright and colourful and a paintbrush with rainbow colours on its bristles. This path had no buckets of paint. It had no sign. It had no brushes or bins. He stood for a moment and thought. He was halfway down now. Should he turn back? Should he keep going? If he made too many mistakes he could get lost. He remembered how he got lost once. He had gone to the store with his dragon. The store was large and filled with everything anyone could want, except nails. There was food and clothes and even toys. He stopped to look at one, and when he turned around his dragon was gone. </p>
    <p>Dragons were a funny thing, and living with a dragon is funnier still. Dragons, by nature, are a dangerous creature to be around. They are temperamental and like everything to be just so. They sleep a lot and like a television to lull them to sleep. They do not like being disturbed and they tend to eat a lot. Sometimes dragons get awakened when they don’t want to be. This makes them angry. Sometimes dragons don’t understand what you are saying. This makes them angry. Sometimes dragons forget you are small and get afraid. Sometimes you make mistakes. This makes them angry too. One thing you don’t want, living with a dragon, is to make them angry. Still… choosing to live with a dragon means that everyone leaves you alone. Neville was grateful. His dragon fed him; not always what he wanted to eat or could even eat, but she did feed him. His dragon took him to the river to bath when there was no water in the house. This was fun. He liked it when there was no water in the house. His dragon gave him clothes. Sometimes they didn’t fit just right, but he always knew he had something to wear. And when he got lost, he knew his dragon would find him….eventually. This time, however, he couldn’t get lost. If his dragon ever found out he broke the rules his life would be over.</p>
    <p>The best thing to do was to keep moving. As long as he walked quietly, like he did with is dragon, he may go unnoticed. If he never went down the same path twice, surely he would reach the wall. So he took a right, then another right, then a left, then another left and found himself back on the path he started. It took several tries. It took so many he thought he would never make it, but he did.</p>
    <p>Having made it to the great wall, Neville grasped his sword firmly, set his helmet square upon his head, reached high over the wall on his tip-toes and clanged the summoning bell. A giant of a man appeared, his thick red beard and piercing brown eyes caused Neville to draw back his hand, lest the large troll grab him and toss him in a boiling pot in the back.</p>
    <p>The last time Neville had visited the old troll made a lasting impression. He had been sent on an errand for some odd thing or another, which he could no longer remember. He entered the Cave of Dyer and found it deserted, save for a small light in the back. The light was to the troll’s inner sanctum, which was dimly lit and smelled funny; like musty old books from a different time and place. There was a large overstuffed chair in the middle of the room, next to a dim light. On the table in front was a pot of something boiling. Whether it was tea, soup, or bones, no one could tell, but it had a spoon in it. There was a small fireplace glowing on the one wall, and again it was adorned with a pot. By the smell of it, it had to be a small boy cooking in there and the walls, covered from floor to ceiling with books, had to contain cooking instructions for that purpose.</p>
    <p class="indented">“Is that you under there, Neville?” the troll asked, leaning over to get a better view of his visitor.</p>
    <p>His booming voice startled Neville back into the present. “Yes sir,” Neville replied, taking off his helmet, now assured the large troll would not be eating him - today, at least. </p>
    <p class="indented">“I…I…need some nails.”</p>
    <p class="indented">“Nails is it? What are you building now, a fort? Are you going to defend the coast?”</p>
    <p class="indented">“No, sir. It’s my sword,” Neville replied, lifting up his regal weapon proudly. “It’s wobbly.”</p>
    <p>The troll looked long and hard at the sword. He stroked his beard with his large thick fingers as he examined it up and down.</p>
    <p class="indented">“I see,” said the troll. “Do you mind if I take a look?”</p>
    <p>Neville thought long and hard, for everyone knows a knight should never part with his sword. What if it should break; more than it was? It could nare be replaced. It took him months to find the cold hard steel and adorn it with precious jewels. The pieces had come from the ancient castle up on the hill, which a dragon had burnt to the ground and where many knights perished. His sword even had remnants of the dragons fiery breath still upon it. But then again, the sword was wobbly and the little knight had little choice but to take help from wherever he could find it. With reluctance, Neville turned over his weapon for inspection. </p>
    <p class="indented">“Did you get this wood from the old burned out bed and breakfast? That’s a very dangerous place, Neville,”  said the troll with a tone suggesting that perhaps Neville was not brave enough to traverse the old burnt-out castle.</p>
    <p class="indented">“I’m not afraid,” Neville replied. “I got these there too,” he said, retrieving several remnants of costume jewellery and a button from his pocket.</p>
    <p>The large old troll gave a nod of approval - or perhaps acceptance that knights will be knights and danger is not something they give into. </p>
    <p class="indented">“It’s a very fine sword. Did you make it all by yourself?”</p>
    <p>Neville nodded with a proud grin.</p>
    <p class="indented">The old troll stroked his woolly red beard again as he reviewed the three bent nails holding the handle to the long wooden plank. “Yes sir, a very fine sword indeed. A bit long, though - for a knight.” He added. “Is it hard to wield?”</p>
    <p class="indented">“I suppose it is a little, but a knight’s sword has to be long,” Neville replied.</p>
    <p class="indented">“Not necessarily. I see by the cross on your tunic that you are a Templar Knight. Those are the bravest knights of all. King Richard the Lionheart was one. Oh yes, they were the bravest of knights. But you see they had short swords, because most of the time they fought on the ground and in very close conditions. Their long swords were kept with their horse. It had a special scabbard, which was attached to the saddle. This way a Templar could go into battle with very little weight, unlike other soldiers. He wore only enough chainmail to cover the most vulnerable parts of his body and only carried one sword and one dagger on his person. Because he was not covered in heavy armour, he could move faster than his opponent; like you, I imagine. You seem the wiry type,” he said with a grin.</p>
    <p class="center">#</p>
    <p>Neville found himself not as afraid as he was on his last visit, but why? Why was the large old troll being so nice; was it to lure him into the pot? And how did the old troll know so much about knights? Did he have to peel off their armour to eat them? Before he could answer, the old troll slipped into the cave and returned with a large book bound in blue with gold edging. He opened it and turned it around for Neville to see. He pointed at one of the knights. </p>
    <p class="indented">“You see?” asked the old troll. “Their armour was almost non-existent and their swords did not touch the ground. It allowed them to run and swing hard, which their opponent could not. I see you cut your cheek. Was it your sword?”</p>
    <p class="indented">“Oh no!” Neville said. “I got that from my helmet. I’m afraid it’s a little wobbly too,” he said, lifting up his helmet.</p>
    <p>The old troll turned over the bucket to reveal the punctures Neville had made for the indented cross and eye slots. They were jagged in several places. He looked down at the boy, not much bigger than a stick, with an old white bed-sheet painted with a red cross held together by his belt. The old troll stared at Neville intently for awhile.</p>
    <p class="indented">“You must be playing hard. I see you bruised your arm as well. Did you get that from your sword?”</p>
    <p>Neville was reluctant to speak about his bruise. He was embarrassed to go into the matter and so turned his eyes away from the old troll. </p>
    <p class="indented">“I see you have put a lot of effort into your sword,” said the troll. “If I could make a suggestion…Two bolts would hold the hilt and guard better to the blade - and they would be safer too?”</p>
    <p>Neville gave the matter some thought. That is to say, he tried and tried to puzzle out what a bolt was. In the end, as not to appear unwise, Neville gave a nod in agreement. The troll disappeared into one of the isles where strange writing adorned the signs above buckets of bolts, nails and other fasteners.</p>
    <p>Neville, like all knights, was well educated. He had been attending knight school for forever now; nearly a quarter of his life. Gone were the days when his days were free to roam the countryside for as long as he pleased. They went the way of those carefree days where food was left on the table by fairies just when he thought he would die of hunger. Yes - education was an important part of a knight’s life; even if he hated it. Yet, Neville pondered. Why did the worms never teach him about these special knights? Did they not know? Surely learning about knights was more important than learning to spell or add numbers. He wondered if the worms, being so forgetful, just…forgot.</p>
    <p>The old troll took so long that Neville decided to follow, lest the old troll have some potion in mind for brewing instead of fixing his sword. He found the troll, digging through one bucket after the other; for what Neville did not know. That said, Neville could read the sign above the bucket closest to him. It said “bolts”, along with some strange writing that seemed to be in code. Neville picked one up - just to see what a “bolt” was.  It was large and covered in a spiral groove with a cap that moved up and down the groove. Was this it? Was this what the old troll had in mind for his sword? It would never work. It was huge and heavy. Perhaps, Neville thought to himself, it was time to slowly back away and grab his sword while he still had a sword and life to hang onto.</p>
    <p class="indented">“There!” the troll announced as he turned around. “That should do it.”</p>
    <p>Neville tried to see what the troll was holding, but his large thick hands made the task impossible. Worse, the young knight was now trapped. He could not make it back to his sword, collect it, and make it out of the caverns before the troll caught him and ate him. All he could do is follow the troll back to his sword and wait for an opportunity to run.</p>
    <p>The troll picked up the sword and held the object he had collected up to the handle then disappeared again into the cave. It would have been the perfect opportunity to run, save that the troll had place the sword too far back on the wall. Neville tried and tried to jump high enough to reach it, but he couldn’t even come close. Finally, the old troll emerged with a large green box. He set it on the wall and opened it, reviling a multitude of tools. Neville tried to stand high on his tip toes to see what was happening, but to no avail. The troll was too large and blocked his view every time he turned around.</p>
    <p>First, the large troll produced a hammer with a claw hook on it. He used the hook to remove the nails one by one as Neville watched intently. Next the troll produced a tool Neville had never seen before. It was shaped like a crooked snake with a flat handle on the top and a drill at the bottom. The curved, almost C-Shaped middle was another handle. The troll loosed the drill bit at the bottom and, digging through his toolbox, produced a very small drill bit. Once securely in place, the old troll placed the two pieces of the sword together and carefully set the drill on top. With one hand atop the first handle and another hand on the second, the troll slowly began to turn the crooked snake from the middle, which turned the tiny drill bit at the bottom. He repeated the action for a second hole. Then, brushing away small bits of wood, the troll picked up the tiny piece of something he had obtained in the buckets.</p>
    <p>All he could do was watch. There was pounding and more pounding, then drilling and more drilling followed by still more pounding. </p>
    <p class="indented">“Surely”, Neville thought, “This is the end of my great sword.” </p>
    <p>Neville’s heart sank until he finally sat down on his helmet, his chin in his hands, and shook his head. Now he had no nails and no sword. Whatever would he do? It was just then that the drilling, sawing and fussing stopped. </p>
    <p>The old troll took apart the tiny piece of something in his hand and place half of it on the wall, giving Neville a chance to examine it more closely. It was a tiny bolt, very much like the larger one he had seen but much smaller. The troll took the tiny bolt and placed it in the holes that he had drilled, then put the tiny nut on the back of the bolt. He repeated the action for the second hole. Then, with another rustle of tools, the troll produced a screwdriver and pliers with which he tightened down the bolts until they could barely be seen.</p>
    <p class="indented">“Here we go,” the old troll said, laying the sword on the counter.</p>
    <p>Neville stood up and stepped up on his helmet. There, laying before him was his magnificent sword so beautiful that it could only have been done through magic.</p>
    <p class="indented">“What do you think?” the old troll asked with a great grin. “Be careful now, the glue isn’t fully dry. Your handle is tight and secure now and I took the liberty of taking off a bit on the length so that it won’t drag on the ground anymore. I secured your jewels with a bit of glue. That should hold them better.”</p>
    <p>The young knight, brandishing the mighty sword in the air, found himself lost for words.</p>
    <p class="indented">“Now, if you let me see that helmet of yours, I think I just might have a spare piece of foam to make it fit better. Shall we give it a try?”</p>
    <p>Nigel took a look, first at his modest handcrafted helmet, then at his beautiful new sword, and willingly handed over his helmet. A few odd sanding noises and many minutes later, the old large troll came back and placed the helmet on Neville’s head. It was a perfect fit - and the inside was smooth to the touch.  It was a fine job indeed, but Neville wondered if so poor a knight could pay him properly. Reaching deep into his pocket he came up with his entire life’s savings, a cog, a piece of blue glass and a bit of string. It hardly seemed enough. Resigned to pay the price, Neville lifted up his tunic, dug deep into his reserve pocket and pulled out the last few pence he had in the world and placed it all on the counter.</p>
    <p class="indented">“Will this be enough?”</p>
    <p class="indented">Mr. Dyer sifted through the coins on the counter and pushed all but two pennies back towards the boy. “This is more than sufficient, I think,” he said with a smile. </p>
    <p>It seemed odd for the old red bearded troll to want so little for his good work. Equally odd was that he didn’t even try to lure him in the back room to eat him, like he had done on their last meeting. Still - trolls will be trolls and you can never know the mind of a troll; even a nice one.</p>
