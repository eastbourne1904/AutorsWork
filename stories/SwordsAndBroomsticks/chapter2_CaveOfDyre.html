    <br>
    <p>The small knight knelt over his sword and wondered to himself how best to right it; for you see, the handle wiggled, and no matter how many times he nailed it in place, the handle would not stop wiggling. It was a very large sword and thus required a very sturdy handle. What he needed was - a rock; for everyone knows that rocks were the best things to put nails in swords, outside of a hammer that is. But if one does not have a hammer one can always count on a rock.</p>
    <p text-indent: 50px;> The colonel put a hand on the small knight’s back and gave it a pat. And with an order he sent his troops out to scour the countryside for just the right rock. It could not be just any rock. It had to be an especially made for putting nails in swords rock. Nail rocks had to be grey for they were the strongest rocks. Today, however, they seemed to be in short supply. They found white rocks. They found speckled rocks. They found red rocks with stripes. And while there were plenty of pretty rocks, everyone knows that pretty rocks were not the best things to use on nails for swords. Sword nails were much too strong. Swords required grey rocks to pound in nails, but all of those rocks were stuck in the ground or way too big. </p>
    <p text-indent: 50px;> Neville tried the white rocks, but they broke. He tried the red rocks, but they bent the nails. He tried the striped rocks and speckled rocks, but they too broke the nails. Now it was truly broken. With no grey rocks to be found and the nails he had, bent and broken, the little knight laid out his sword upon the ground.</p>
    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp “It’s no good,” Neville said. “It’s going to need new nails.”</p>
