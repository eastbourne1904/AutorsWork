    <h2 class="center">Ghost of the Mutlah</h2>
    <br>
        <p>We were seated by the fire one evening, my wife and I, when the maid brought in a small parcel. As I had retired from the bar, I was not accustomed to receiving deliveries after the usual post and so I eagerly looked for a sender. There was none. Suddenly, as if the past hauntingly infringed upon the present, my heart felt heavy in my chest. With trembling hands I opened it, pulling out an old careworn medallion attached to a chain. I recognised it at once, though it had been more than fifty years since I had seen it. It belonged to my brother. A little souvenir of our travels during the war and our own adventures there. It was an odd little thing, but it once solved one of the most sinister crimes to cross the Queen’s Bench.</p>
        <p>Fondling the medallion between my fingers I felt the years melting away until I could almost smell the spicy Jamaican food lingering in the breeze. Jamaica in July was hot and sultry; hotter even than Australia, which we frequented every summer. My brother Johnny liked it though. He never seemed to mind the heat. He climbed up on the railing letting his flaxen hair wave wildly in the breeze as we pulled into port on the great naval ship MHS Belfast. I had never seen water so clear before. The sea seemed to hold the white sandy beaches in a gentle embrace. We were enthralled, imagining pirates around every corner with great stores of treasure stolen from strong British ships; ships like the one we arrived on. For Her Majesty’s honour and for England, we would have to avenge them at the tip of a sword. We could not, of course, imbibe on the adventures of pirates ourselves. We were, at least for that day, commissioned to Her Majesty’s navy. We were sworn protectorates of the high seas, dead enemies of pirates and slave traders. We were uniformed officers bound to rule the waves. Hip hip hurrah! We would have the homecoming of heroes, returning its horde to Her Majesty for the good of the Empire.</p>
        <p>I took my brother’s frail little hand and lead him down to safer shores, at least for the moment. We would indeed take up the cause, but it would have to wait until we were settled in the hotel. During those years, before the war, my grandfather and his partner, travelled as Law Lords to various countries, working with Colonial Judiciaries on behalf of the Crown. On the whole it was marvellous fun, filled with adventure and new experiences at every turn, but arriving at each new place was typically dreary. It entailed a couple of hours sitting stone-faced in a chair, staring out the window in inexorable boredom as their Lordships exchanged pleasantries with their peers.</p>
        <p>Arriving at the hotel I gave a weary sigh at the thought of spending yet another day indoors. The streets were full of interesting faces and people in colourful garb glittering like the bay. Grandfather gave me a wink, rustling my hair as Johnny and I slunk out of the motor. He knew how hard it was for us. This time, however, he had a surprise waiting for us in the lobby. The Minister of Justice had two young boys accompanying him, very close on to our own age. We stared at each other, amidst the introductions, waiting anxiously to be released. Andre was the eldest and, like me, deported himself beyond his years. His English was so well spoken one might have taken him to have been educated in England, though we learned he had never gone beyond the boundaries of Jamaica. Trey was no more than seven or eight. He, like my brother, was a sprightly youngster whose curiosity knew no bounds. It did not take us long to become instant and life-long friends, racing down the hall to the outdoors.</p>
        <p>Driven by the blistering sun, we headed first to the beach, spending the morning swimming in the lagoon and supping on ortaniques, ugli, and roasted breadfruit. After lunch Andre and Trey took us out past Charlotte’s Fort and around the cove to an old ship’s graveyard by way of the forest. There we transformed ourselves into the most ruthless pirates and most dedicated men of Her Majesty’s navy, respectively. We collected treasures of seashells, shiny rocks and discarded bits along the way, stopping at the picaresque pile of retired ships with great anticipation. It took a little doing to get Johnny to give up treasure hunting to climb aboard, but pressure applied in the most usual brotherly way, he acquiesced. He had done very well for himself, filling his pockets full of all sorts of bobbly bits while the rest of us fought pirates and soldiers.</p>
        <p class="a">‘Come on, Johnny,’ I said, growing impatience at his reluctance. ‘You can dig for treasure later.’</p>
        <p>Up until that point I felt I had been rather tolerant with him, but his constant lagging behind and drifting off had tested my patience. I wanted to play pirates with my new friends and I wasn’t about to let my little brother spoil it.</p>
        <p class="a">‘If you don’t come, I’m telling grand pa pa you wouldn’t listen to me,’ I insisted. I got nowhere, of course and felt a heavier hand was called for. ‘If you don’t listen, grand pa pa is going to send Mr. Willow away forever and ever and you’ll never get to see him again!’</p>
        <p>It was a horrid cruel thing to say to him. He loved Mr. Willow. The pair were inseparable and I knew it. I wasn’t deliberately trying to be cruel, though there was an angry part of me that wanted some sort of revenge for his insolence. Johnny wasn’t going to listen to me, nor would he care what grandfather thought, but there was one thing he did cared about. He was unusually close to Willow. In threatening to separate him from Willow I thought to give him a right good swat that would make him think twice before being disobedient to me. Its effect, however, was vastly different than my intent. He stood there for a moment staring at me. I could see him trembling until a single tear escaped and ran down his cheek. His hand let go of his little bag of treasures and he sunk to his knees weeping inconsolably. It was heart-wrenching. Johnny was a tender soul. I never quite understood him, really. His mind was constantly wandering off, dreaming and thinking thoughts most of us don’t think of. But it was more than his imagination. Johnny had a heart that was soft, but a determination that was a will of iron. He was brave the day he fell out of a tree and broke his leg, yet he cries in his sleep and sometimes still wets the bed in fear. He was the most incredible person I had ever met or, indeed, would ever meet.</p>
        <p class="a">I rushed to his side, realising what I had done. ‘I didn’t mean it, Johnny. He’s not going to leave, I swear it. It’s alright,’ I consoled, rocking him in my arms.</p>
        <p class="a">‘What’s the matter?’ Trey asked, coming to see what had happened. ‘What’s the matter Johnny?’</p>
        <p class="a">‘It’s okay,” I replied. “He’s just upset.’</p>
        <p class="a">‘Why don’t he talk?’</p>
        <p>It was such an innocent question, but one I hated to answer. For me, all I wanted was a normal life, but this one thing quite prohibited it. Johnny didn’t talk; he never talked. He hadn’t spoken a word over two years, ever since he saw our father killed. I cannot imagine what my brother saw, but it was enough to send him into a silent world of his own. It was Willow who found him and rushed him away that night and it was Willow he clung to ever since.</p>
