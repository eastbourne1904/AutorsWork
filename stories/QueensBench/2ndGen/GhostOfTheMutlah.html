        <p>We were seated by the fire one evening, my wife and I, when the maid brought in a small parcel. As I had retired from the bar, I was not accustomed to receiving deliveries after the usual post and so I eagerly looked for a sender. There was none. Suddenly, as if the past hauntingly infringed upon the present, my heart felt heavy in my chest. With trembling hands I opened it, pulling out an old careworn medallion attached to a chain. I recognised it at once, though it had been more than fifty years since I had seen it. It belonged to my brother. A little souvenir of our travels during the war and our own adventures there. It was an odd little thing, but it once solved one of the most sinister crimes to cross the Queenâ€™s Bench.</p>
